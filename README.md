#  Countdown

**Countdown** is an app where you can create a countdown for any event.

**Countdown** is built using SwiftUI and uses the Text structure to animate the countdown using the initialiser from iOS 14 that takes a DateStyle argument.

To add a countdown simple tap the plus button at the top of the screen. When you do, the countdown modifier screen will appear and here you can change the countdown's title, the duration, and the colour of the countdown. To change the duration, rotate the circle by dragging on either the seconds or the minutes circle and this will change the duration.

To start the countdown press the play button; you can pause the countdown at anytime. When the timer finishes you will be alerted by the background colour flashing and an alert sound. If you are not in the app a standard notification will appear (only if you have given permission to the app). To modify the countdown when the countdown isn't running, tap anywhere on the cell and then the modifier screen will appear.
